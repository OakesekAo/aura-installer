# Aura Installer Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### UI Implementation
- [x] Created dropdown with three display variants (2.4" ILI9341, 2.4" ST7789, 2.8" ILI9341)
- [x] Updated HTML to use `<esp-web-install-button>` with dynamic manifest switching
- [x] JavaScript to update manifest path when dropdown changes
- [x] Preserved existing help documentation and styling

### Manifest Architecture
- [x] Created manifests that fetch binaries directly from OakesekAo/Aura releases
- [x] No local binary hosting - all files fetched from source repository
- [x] Each variant points to specific firmware files from latest release
- [x] Proper ESP32 flash layout with correct offsets

### File Structure (Simplified)
- [x] Lightweight installer with only manifest files:
  ```
  manifests/
    24_ILI9341.json    # 2.4" ILI9341 variant
    24_ST7789.json     # 2.4" ST7789 variant  
    28_ILI9341.json    # 2.8" ILI9341 variant
  index.html           # Main installer page
  ```

### Manifest URLs
- [x] All manifests fetch from: `https://github.com/OakesekAo/Aura/releases/latest/download/`
- [x] Expected firmware file naming:
  - bootloader-{variant}.bin
  - partitions-{variant}.bin
  - boot_app0-{variant}.bin  
  - app-{variant}.bin

### Documentation
- [x] Updated README.md with new architecture
- [x] GitHub Pages deployment workflow
- [x] Manifest validation workflow

## üöß Dependencies (Base Repo)

The installer is now ready, but requires the base Aura repository to:

### Release Artifacts Required
- [ ] bootloader-24_ILI9341.bin, partitions-24_ILI9341.bin, boot_app0-24_ILI9341.bin, app-24_ILI9341.bin
- [ ] bootloader-24_ST7789.bin, partitions-24_ST7789.bin, boot_app0-24_ST7789.bin, app-24_ST7789.bin  
- [ ] bootloader-28_ILI9341.bin, partitions-28_ILI9341.bin, boot_app0-28_ILI9341.bin, app-28_ILI9341.bin

### Base Repo Setup Needed
- [ ] CI workflow to build all three variants
- [ ] Release automation to upload binaries with correct naming
- [ ] ESP32 system binaries (bootloader, partitions, boot_app0) for each variant

## ÔøΩ Ready for Deployment

### Installer Status
- ‚úÖ Complete and ready to deploy
- ‚úÖ Automatically fetches latest firmware 
- ‚úÖ No binary hosting needed
- ‚úÖ Always up-to-date with base repository releases

### Next Steps
1. **Enable GitHub Pages** for aura-installer repository
2. **Set up CI in base Aura repo** to build all variants and create releases
3. **Test with real hardware** once base repo releases are available

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria Status

- ‚úÖ Page shows Screen dropdown with three variants
- ‚úÖ Changing dropdown updates `<esp-web-install-button>` to correct manifest
- ‚úÖ Each manifest references all four images at correct offsets
- ‚úÖ Manifests fetch binaries from base repository (no local hosting)
- ‚úÖ Brief README/landing documentation completed

## üåê Deployment Ready

The installer is now:
- Lightweight (no large binary files)
- Self-updating (always fetches latest release)
- Ready for GitHub Pages deployment
- Waiting only on base repository CI setup
